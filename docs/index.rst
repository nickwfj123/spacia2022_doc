Spacia: Inferring Cell-cell Interaction from Spatial Transcriptomics Data
===================================

Multicellular organisms heavily rely on cell-cell interactions to effectively coordinate and regulate various biological processes, ensuring the normal functioning of the organism. Spacia models and evaluates cell-cell interactions from spatial transcriptomic data (SRT). This model uses cell-cell proximity as a constraint and prioritizes cell-cell interactions that cause a downstream change in the cells. Spacia employs a Bayesian multi-instance learning (MIL) framework to assess intercellular communication from between cells and their neighbors.
